    "\n",
    "* **Our Choice:** In this case, I designated the \"id\" column as the primary key, recognizing that it holds unique values for each loan record.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.2. Choosing between VARCHAR and NVARCHAR**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Rationale:** I noticed that many string columns were initially assigned the NVARCHAR(50) datatype. Knowing that our dataset exclusively uses English characters, I converted these to VARCHAR(50) to improve storage efficiency. NVARCHAR stores data using Unicode, which supports a wider range of characters, while VARCHAR uses a more space-efficient encoding for standard English text.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.3. Adjusting Character Limits:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Example:** For the \"emp_title\" column, I increased the character limit from 50 to 100 to accommodate some longer job titles present in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.4. Changing INT vs. SMALLINT**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Reasoning:** I observed that the \"loan_amnt\" and \"total_pymnt\" columns were initially set as SMALLINT. Since our dataset contains loan values that exceed the maximum range supported by SMALLINT, I changed the datatype to INT to prevent potential errors. INT allows for a wider range of integer values.\n",
